# Shiny Chart Doctor

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Shiny Chart Doctor**, a data visualization tool inspired by the FT Chart Doctor column by Alan Smith, Head of Visual and Data Journalism at the Financial Times. This Shiny application serves as an interactive guide and tool for creating compelling and informative charts.

## Overview

The **Shiny Chart Doctor** is designed to bring the principles and techniques of effective data visualization, as championed by Alan Smith in his FT Chart Doctor column, to a wider audience. By translating and incorporating these insights into an interactive Shiny app, we aim to make high-quality data visualization more accessible and intuitive.

### Key Features:

- **Interactive Guidance:** The app provides step-by-step assistance in creating data visualizations, drawing from Alan Smith's expert insights.
- **German Language Interface:** Tailored for a German-speaking audience, particularly public officials, to support their work in data presentation.
- **Based on Voronoys Template:** Utilizes the Voronoys project as a foundation, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.

## Usage

The Shiny Chart Doctor is primarily intended for use in workshops and educational settings, particularly focusing on German public officials involved in the NFDI (German Federal Data Infrastructure) project. However, it can be a valuable tool for anyone interested in improving their data visualization skills.
